# This script no longer decides the ordinary "PR must be raised via no-mistakes"
# required check. That check is decided by the shared composite action
# kunchenguid/no-mistakes/.github/actions/require-no-mistakes, pinned in
# .github/workflows/no-mistakes-required.yml. Its bot exemptions ride the
# action's exempt-authors input.
#
# This script has exactly one live consumer: release.yml's
# release-pr-gate-status job, which stamps the required status context onto a
# release-please PR head. release-please opens its PRs with GITHUB_TOKEN, so
# GitHub creates no workflow runs for them and nothing else can report the
# required context there.
#
# The script still implements the signature/attestation, bot, and structural
# release-please branches. Its only live caller deliberately overrides PR_AUTHOR
# with a sentinel value, making the bot branch unreachable on that path. It also
# does not export PR_HEAD_SHA, so this script sees an empty head SHA and cannot
# pass through its attestation branch. Only the STRUCTURAL release-please
# conditions (reserved branch prefix, same-repository head, and Release Please
# body footer) can therefore pass there. This is load-bearing: exporting
# PR_HEAD_SHA from release.yml would make the attestation branch reachable and
# invalidate this guarantee.
#
# The release-please test is deliberately STRUCTURAL, never author identity. If
# release-please is ever switched to a PAT, its PRs could arrive as the human
# `kunchenguid`, who also opens ordinary human PRs. Exempting that login would
# exempt every human PR too.
#
# Inputs (environment):
#   PR_BODY, PR_AUTHOR, PR_NUMBER, PR_HEAD_REF, PR_HEAD_REPO, PR_BASE_REPO,
#   PR_HEAD_SHA (github.event.pull_request.head.sha; required on the
#   attestation path so a later push cannot pass on a stale comment)
# Exit status: 0 = pass, 1 = fail.
