<h3 align="center">Manage worktrees without managing worktrees.</h3>

Are you still only working on one task at a time? Are you manually juggling between a few clones of the same repo?

Or... are you starting a new worktree for every agent session, losing all your installed dependencies and build cache each time, and wondering why your agents are slow?

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kunchenguid/treehouse/main/demo.gif" alt="treehouse demo" width="800" />
</p>

Treehouse helps you manage a pool of reusable, isolated worktrees so each of your agents gets its own environment instantly — no cloning, no conflicts, no coordination overhead.

- **Instant isolation** — `treehouse` puts you into a clean worktree with zero hassel.
- **Reusable worktrees** — worktrees are preserved in a pool when you're done, with dependencies and build cache intact, ready for the next agent.
- **Conflict-free** — automatic detection of in-use worktrees and your agents never step on each other's toes.

## Quick Start

```sh
$ cd myproject                 # start in your repo as usual
$ treehouse                    # get a worktree and drop into a subshell
🌳 Entered worktree at ~/.treehouse/myproject-a1b2c3/1/myproject. Type 'exit' to return.

# You're now in an isolated worktree.
# Run your AI agent, make changes, do whatever you need.

$ exit                         # exit the subshell when you're done
🌳 Terminated lingering processes: opencode (pid 12345)
🌳 Worktree returned to pool.
```

## Install

**macOS / Linux**

```sh
curl -fsSL https://kunchenguid.github.io/treehouse/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
irm https://kunchenguid.github.io/treehouse/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Nix**

```sh
nix run github:kunchenguid/treehouse
# or pin a specific release tag:
nix run github:kunchenguid/treehouse/v2.3.0
```

Install into your Nix profile:

```sh
nix profile add github:kunchenguid/treehouse
```

Or add to your flake inputs:

```nix
treehouse = {
  url = "github:kunchenguid/treehouse";
  inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
};
```

The flake exposes `#default` and `#treehouse` package outputs, plus `apps` for `nix run`.

**Go**

```sh
go install github.com/kunchenguid/treehouse@latest
```

**From source**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kunchenguid/treehouse.git
cd treehouse
make install
```

## How It Works

Treehouse manages a **pool of git worktrees** per repository, stored under the configured treehouse root.
The default treehouse root is `~/.treehouse/` (or `$TREEHOUSE_HOME` / `$TREEHOUSE_WORKTREES` when those env vars are set; see Configuration).
You can instead keep the pool [inside the project](#in-project-storage) with `--root .`, so it lives next to the code and is removed with the project.

  (ready for next agent)
```

- **Detached HEAD** — worktrees use detached HEAD mode, reset to whichever of the local or remote default branch is further ahead, avoiding branch name conflicts entirely.
- **Choosable base branch** — set `base_branch` in `treehouse.toml`, or pass `treehouse get --base <branch>`, to cut worktrees from a branch other than the repository default. Opt-in; unset keeps today's inference. Worktrees stay in detached HEAD — this selects the commit they start at, it does not create or check out a branch.
- **No daemon** - all operations are inline CLI commands.
  Pool state is a small on-disk file, written under a lock by each command.
- **In-use detection** — treehouse scans running processes and short-lived owner reservations to determine which worktrees are in-use. Reservations are persisted only while `get`, `destroy`, and `prune` lifecycle work is running.
- **Durable leases** - `treehouse get --lease` reserves a worktree as a persistent home without keeping a process inside it. Each acquisition gets an immutable random lease identity, and the lease is recorded in treehouse's own state. The worktree is never handed out by a later `get` and never removed by `prune` until you release it with `treehouse return`. Unlike process-based in-use detection, a lease survives with zero processes running inside the worktree.
- **State recovery** - treehouse writes pool state atomically via a temp file and replacement.
  If an existing state file is empty or truncated, treehouse warns, rebuilds entries from worktrees still on disk, and marks those entries leased until you verify them with `treehouse status`.
- **Dirty detection** - treehouse treats tracked changes and untracked files as dirty, even when repository config hides untracked files from normal `git status` output.
- **Safe pruning** - By default, `treehouse prune` removes only idle managed worktrees whose HEAD is already merged into the default branch and whose working tree is clean.
  `treehouse prune --all` applies the same safety checks across every managed pool under the user-level treehouse root.
  Backing-repository-missing orphans are reported by default; `--prune-orphans` includes them as unverified prune candidates, and `--yes` is required before deletion.
  It is a dry run unless you pass `--yes`.
- **Self-healing get** - `treehouse get` prunes stale git worktree bookkeeping (e.g. left behind by a crashed or forcibly removed worktree) before adding a new worktree, so a prunable registration never wedges the pool with a "missing but already registered worktree" error.

| `destroy` | `--include-leased` | Also remove a leased worktree; only when the exact path is named, never via `--all` |

### Leasing a worktree (no subshell)

`treehouse get` normally opens an interactive subshell whose lifetime is the hold: when the shell exits, the worktree returns to the pool.
That is awkward for callers that need a worktree to persist as a permanent home with no long-lived process inside it.

`treehouse get --lease` is the non-interactive, durable alternative:

```sh
path=$(treehouse get --lease)
# $path is the leased worktree's absolute path; all banners went to stderr.
```

It acquires a worktree exactly like `get`, but instead of opening a subshell it marks the worktree **leased** in treehouse's persistent state. By default it prints only the worktree's absolute path to stdout; `--json` prints the lease allocation instead. Every human-facing message goes to stderr, so either output mode stays clean.

A leased worktree is never handed out by a later `get` and never removed by `prune`, regardless of whether any process runs inside it, until the lease is explicitly released.
A bulk `treehouse destroy <pool> --all` never removes it either; only naming its exact path with `treehouse destroy <path> --include-leased --yes` will.

Pass `--lease-holder <label>` (or set `$TREEHOUSE_LEASE_HOLDER`) to record who holds the lease; `treehouse status` then shows it next to the `leased` state.

Every acquisition receives a new random `lease_id`, including reacquiring the same path with the same holder. Automation can request a stable machine-readable allocation:

```sh
treehouse get --lease --lease-holder automation-A --json
# {"path":"...","lease_id":"...","lease_holder":"automation-A","leased_at":"...","base_branch":"main"}
```

Callers that already fetched the required refs can avoid another network operation with `--no-fetch`:

```sh
git fetch origin main refs/pull/123/head
treehouse get --lease --no-fetch --json
```

With `--no-fetch`, Treehouse resets or creates the worktree from existing local refs and never contacts `origin`. The caller is responsible for ensuring those refs and objects are current.

`treehouse status --json` returns an array with `name`, `path`, `status`, `flavor`, `lease_id`, `lease_holder`, `leased_at`, and `processes`. `flavor` is the backend the worktree's own marker identifies (`"git"` or `"jj"`) and is omitted when no marker is found. Non-leased entries use empty lease strings and a `null` timestamp. State files written before lease identities remain readable; their existing leases have an empty `lease_id` until released and acquired again.

Release a lease with `treehouse return <path>`, which terminates lingering processes and verifies that no foreign process remains before it resets the worktree, clears the lease, and returns the worktree to the pool.
If process termination or that verification fails, the command exits nonzero and leaves the worktree and lease in place instead of recycling a slot that may still be in use.
When you pass an explicit path, `treehouse return` can run from outside the repository because it resolves the managed pool from that worktree path.

For retry-safe automation, condition the return on the identity from allocation or status:

```sh
treehouse return --force \
  --if-lease-id "$lease_id" \
  --if-lease-holder "$lease_holder" \
  "$path"
```

Treehouse compares supplied conditions while holding the pool state lock. A missing lease or mismatch exits nonzero before process termination, worktree reset, or state clearing. The same lock fences a matching return through the final clear, so the identity succeeds once and cannot release a later acquisition of the same path. `--if-lease-holder` is optional; use `--if-lease-id` for ABA protection when a holder may be reused.

For backward compatibility, `treehouse return <path>` without either condition keeps its original unconditional path-only behavior. Existing path-only scripts and `treehouse get --lease` stdout are unchanged.

### Recovering a damaged pool state file

Treehouse writes `treehouse-state.json` atomically, so a crash mid-write should leave the previous state file intact.
If an existing state file is empty or truncated, commands do not fail just because the JSON cannot be parsed.
They print a warning, rebuild the pool entries from worktree directories still on disk, and mark every recovered entry as `leased` because treehouse cannot know whether it was idle, in-use, or durably leased.

Run `treehouse status` to inspect recovered entries.
After verifying a worktree is safe to reuse, run `treehouse return <path>` to clear the safety lease.
To delete one instead, name its exact path with `treehouse destroy <path> --include-leased --yes`.
Bulk `destroy --all` and prune leave recovered entries alone.

### Pruning stale worktrees and orphans

`treehouse prune` is a dry run by default.
By default, it lists stale idle managed worktrees that would be deleted and shows the reclaimable disk space.
Pass `treehouse prune --yes` to delete those worktrees.

By default, prune only inspects the current repository's pool and must be run inside a repository.
Pass `treehouse prune --all` or `treehouse prune --global` to inspect every managed pool under the user-level treehouse root from any directory.
Global prune reads the user-level config and hooks, derives each worktree's owning repository from version-control metadata, then fetches and checks merge safety against that repository.
Without `--prune-orphans`, pass `treehouse prune --all --yes` to delete only the globally safe stale candidates.

Prune ignores worktrees that are currently in use, leased, or reserved by another lifecycle operation.
It skips idle worktrees that are unsafe to remove and prints the skip reason, such as uncommitted tracked or untracked changes, or a HEAD commit that is not merged into the default branch.
Skip output is grouped by reason so large global sweeps stay scannable.
When `origin` exists, prune fetches it and proves each HEAD against the current remote default branch tracking ref.
Without `origin`, prune uses the local default branch ref.
If `origin` cannot be reached, prune reports `origin unreachable (cannot verify)` and leaves the worktree untouched, even when `--prune-orphans` is set.
If a linked worktree points at a missing backing repository, prune reports `orphaned (backing repository missing)`.
Plain `treehouse prune` and `treehouse prune --all` never delete those orphans.
Pass `--prune-orphans` to include true backing-repository-missing orphans in the dry run, then add `--yes` to delete them.
Treehouse cannot verify orphan contents after the backing version-control metadata is gone, so each orphan candidate is marked `content could not be verified`.
Use `--verbose` to show the underlying version-control diagnostic details for skipped worktrees.

### Destroying worktrees

`treehouse destroy` is the deliberate tool for removing a worktree even though it still has unlanded work, but it is safe by default and holds itself to the same bar as `prune`.

Targets are narrow and explicit:

- `treehouse destroy <worktree-path>` targets exactly one worktree.
- `treehouse destroy <pool-path> --all` targets worktrees in THAT pool only. The pool path can be the pool directory, a worktree inside it, or the repository (`.` works from inside a repo).

There is no cross-pool or global destroy: `--all` without a pool path is an error, so a stray command can never reach beyond the pool you named.

Destroy is a dry run by default.
It prints a risk-revealing preview - one or more status labels (`[disposable]`, `[leased]`, `[in-use:<pid>]`, `[unmerged]`, `[dirty]`, `[unverified]`, or a comma-separated combination such as `[leased,dirty]`), the path, and the size of each target - and removes nothing.
Pass `--yes` to execute.
It never prints a blind "all worktrees destroyed"; the summary always reports exactly what was destroyed and what was skipped.

A bare `treehouse destroy <pool> --all --yes` removes only the genuinely disposable set (merged, clean, idle, unleased - the same set `prune` would take) and SKIPS everything else, telling you which flag would include it.
Each risky class is its own opt-in, so removing risky worktrees can never be a reflexive `--yes`:

- `--include-unlanded` also removes worktrees with uncommitted changes, a HEAD not merged into the default branch, or contents treehouse cannot verify, such as a missing backing repository (irreversible data loss).
- `--include-in-use` also removes worktrees with a running process or owner reservation; their processes are terminated cleanly first and their pids are shown in the preview.
- `--include-leased` also removes a leased worktree, but only when you name the exact worktree path. Leased worktrees are NEVER removed by `--all`; combining `--include-leased` with `--all` is rejected.

A single named worktree that is skipped for lack of a flag makes the command exit non-zero, so scripts notice that nothing happened.
Bulk `--all` skips are normal and exit zero; inspect the summary to see what remains.

#### Migrating from `--force`

The old blunt `treehouse destroy --force` flag has been removed.
It overrode every protection at once - in-use, unmerged, dirty, and leased - which is what made it dangerous.
Replace it with the specific `--include-*` flag(s) for the risk you actually intend to override, plus `--yes`:

| Old | New |
| --- | --- |
| `treehouse destroy <path> --force` | `treehouse destroy <path> --yes` (add `--include-unlanded` / `--include-in-use` / `--include-leased` as needed) |
| `treehouse destroy --all --force` | `treehouse destroy <pool> --all --yes` (add `--include-unlanded` for dirty, unmerged, or unverified targets, and `--include-in-use` for in-use targets; leased homes are never included) |

## Configuration

Create a repo config file with `treehouse init`, or add one manually:

**Repo-level:** `treehouse.toml` in the repository root

**User-level:** `~/.config/treehouse/config.toml` by default, or `$TREEHOUSE_HOME/config.toml` when `TREEHOUSE_HOME` is set

```toml
# Maximum number of worktrees in the pool
max_trees = 16

# Optional worktree root directory.
# Empty uses $HOME/.treehouse (or $TREEHOUSE_HOME / $TREEHOUSE_WORKTREES when set).
# Relative paths are resolved from the repo root for repo-scoped commands.
# Use "." to keep the pool inside the project (see "In-project storage" below).
# Use an absolute user-level root for treehouse prune --all.
# root = "$HOME/worktrees"

# Optional base branch worktrees are cut from.
# Unset infers it from the repository (see "Base branch" below).
# base_branch = "develop"

# Optional version-control backend. Git is the default everywhere; set "jj"
# to opt in to the experimental Jujutsu backend
# (see "Version-control backend" below).
# vcs = "jj"
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `TREEHOUSE_HOME` | Replaces `$HOME/.treehouse` as the durable Treehouse home. User config is `$TREEHOUSE_HOME/config.toml`. When `TREEHOUSE_WORKTREES` is unset, pools live directly under this path (no extra `.treehouse` segment). |
| `TREEHOUSE_WORKTREES` | Optional. Parent directory for pools; worktrees go directly under it (`$TREEHOUSE_WORKTREES/{repo}-{hash}/...`). |

Both must be absolute paths (after env expansion). Pool-root precedence is `TREEHOUSE_WORKTREES` > config `root` > `TREEHOUSE_HOME` > `$HOME/.treehouse`. Config `root` still appends `.treehouse`; the env vars do not.

`treehouse env` prints the effective home, worktrees root, and user config path (including `$HOME`-derived defaults when the env vars are unset)—useful for verifying mounts in a devcontainer:

```sh
: "${TREEHOUSE_HOME:=/workspaces/.treehouse-home}"
export TREEHOUSE_HOME
# optional separate volume for large worktrees:
# export TREEHOUSE_WORKTREES=/mnt/worktrees
treehouse env
```

The repo-level config takes precedence for repo-safe settings.
`treehouse prune --all` can run without a repository, so it uses only the user-level config and does not read per-repo `treehouse.toml` files while sweeping.
If no config is found, the default pool size is 16.

### Base branch

By default Treehouse infers the branch worktrees are cut from: `origin/HEAD`, then the checked-out branch, then `init.defaultBranch`.
That inference is invisible and can drift — `origin/HEAD` is only set at clone time, and some clones never have it at all.

Set it explicitly for the whole pool:

```toml
base_branch = "develop"
```

or for a single acquisition:

```sh
treehouse get --base develop
treehouse get --lease --base release/2.x --json
```

`--base` wins over `base_branch`, and both are opt-in: with neither set, the inference is unchanged.

A few things worth knowing:

- **Worktrees stay in detached HEAD.** This selects the commit a worktree starts at; it does not create or check out a branch. There is no `-b` shorthand, because `-b` means branch *creation* in git and this flag creates nothing.
- **Branch names only.** `develop`, not `origin/develop`, a tag, or a commit SHA. Whichever of `develop` and `origin/develop` is further ahead wins, preferring `origin` when they have diverged — exactly how the inferred default behaves. A tag sharing a branch's name never wins: refs are resolved fully qualified.
- **It fails closed.** A base that resolves to neither a local branch nor `origin/<branch>` is an error; Treehouse never falls back to the inferred default, which would hand you a worktree cut from the wrong branch and report success. `treehouse status` shows the resolved base, and flags a configured one it cannot resolve.
- **Returned worktrees are parked on the base they were cut from**, so the pool keeps recycling. `base_branch` wins when it is set; otherwise a slot acquired with `--base` is parked back on that branch. A slot parked elsewhere could not be reused whenever the base is not a descendant of it.
- **Existing pools migrate on their own.** A slot is recycled onto a newly requested base as long as it carries nothing beyond the base it was cut from; the two bases need no ancestry relation, so a `develop` slot rejoins a plain `treehouse get` and vice versa. A slot holding commits the new base does not contain is still refused, as always.
- **Git backend only for now.** Under the jj backend an explicit base fails with a clear error rather than silently using the default bookmark.

### Version-control backend (git or Jujutsu)

Treehouse works in git and [Jujutsu (jj)](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) repositories.
**The jj backend is experimental**: it is newer than the git backend and has seen far less production use, so treat it accordingly and report issues.
In a jj repository, pooled worktrees are [jj workspaces](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/working-copy/#workspaces) instead of git worktrees; the pool, lease, and safety machinery is identical.

Git is the default backend everywhere, including in colocated repositories (both `.jj` and `.git`) and `.jj`-only repositories.
Opt in to the jj backend with `vcs = "jj"`, resolved in this precedence (highest first): the `TREEHOUSE_VCS` environment variable, the repo-level `treehouse.toml`, the user-level `~/.config/treehouse/config.toml`.
The jj opt-in only applies where a `.jj` directory actually exists; in a plain git repository it is silently ignored and git is used, so a shell-wide `TREEHOUSE_VCS=jj` never breaks git-only repositories.
A `vcs` value other than `"git"` or `"jj"` (e.g. `"Jujutsu"`) is ignored the same way, but warns once on stderr naming the value and where it came from, so a typo keeps commands working without silently leaving you on the wrong backend.
Pooled jj workspaces inherit the opt-in from their main repository root, so an untracked `treehouse.toml` there is enough.

The backend is resolved on every command, and existing pool slots keep the flavor they were created with: changing the opt-in does not convert worktrees already in the pool.
`destroy` and `prune` handle each slot by its own flavor (its `.git` or `.jj` marker), so a git worktree is still cleanly deregistered from git even after opting the repository into jj, and vice versa.
A slot whose marker is missing entirely (a damaged slot) is never reused, reset, or detached; `treehouse status` reports it as `damaged`, `treehouse return` only clears its lease, `prune` reports it as unverifiable, and `treehouse destroy <path> --include-unlanded` removes it.
`treehouse get` is flavor-aware too: it only reuses slots matching the backend the repository currently selects, and creates new slots with that backend, so a caller who opted in to jj is never handed a git worktree (or vice versa).
Old-flavor slots stay in the pool untouched — `treehouse status` marks them and they count toward `max_trees` — until you migrate them: `treehouse destroy` the old slots and re-acquire with `treehouse get`.

jj-backend notes:

- Pooled worktrees are jj workspaces and are not colocated: they contain `.jj` but no `.git`, so run jj commands (not git) inside them.
- A worktree is considered dirty when its working-copy commit `@` is non-empty or has a description.
- Resets abandon only the working-copy commit and are recoverable with `jj op restore`.
- Merge detection uses ancestry; squash-merged work is treated as unmerged, so lifecycle commands err on the side of keeping it.
- The default branch resolves to the `main`/`master`/`trunk` bookmark, preferring origin.
- A pooled jj workspace whose backing repository was deleted is classified as an orphan just like a git worktree: `prune` reports it, and `prune --prune-orphans --yes` reclaims it.

### Worktree root

The worktree root can also be set without a config file, and the resolved value follows this precedence (highest first):

1. The `--root` flag (e.g. `treehouse get --root .`)
2. The `TREEHOUSE_ROOT` environment variable
3. `root` in the repo-level `treehouse.toml`
4. `root` in the user-level `~/.config/treehouse/config.toml`
5. The default, `~/.treehouse`

A relative value (including `.`) is resolved from the repo root, exactly like a relative `root` in config; `treehouse` is always appended, so `--root .` places the pool at `<repo>/.treehouse/`.

### In-project storage

By default the pool lives in the global `~/.treehouse` store. Set the root to `.` to keep it **inside the project** instead:

```sh
treehouse get --root .          # one-off
export TREEHOUSE_ROOT=.         # for a shell session
```

or commit it for the whole repo in `treehouse.toml`:

```toml
root = "."
```

This is **opt-in**; the default global store is unchanged. In-project mode:

- Places the pool at `<repo>/.treehouse/`, so worktrees sit next to the code and are **removed with the project** (`rm -rf <repo>` leaves no global orphan).
- Git-ignores the pool directory automatically, so it stays out of `git add`.
- Is not reached by `treehouse prune --all`, which only sweeps the global root; in-project pools are removed with the project instead.

### Hooks

You can run commands automatically at worktree lifecycle points by adding a `[hooks]` section to the user-level config (`~/.config/treehouse/config.toml`, or `$TREEHOUSE_HOME/config.toml` when `TREEHOUSE_HOME` is set).
Hooks in repo-level `treehouse.toml` are ignored for safety.
`treehouse destroy` always reads `pre_destroy` from the user-level config because it can target a pool by path.

```toml
[hooks]
post_create = ["./scripts/setup-venv.sh"]
pre_destroy = ["./scripts/teardown.sh"]
```

- `post_create` runs after a worktree is provisioned or reset and right before `treehouse get` hands it to you.
  For `treehouse get --lease`, stdout from `post_create` is routed to stderr so stdout remains the leased path.
- `pre_destroy` runs before a worktree is removed by `treehouse destroy <path> --yes`, `treehouse destroy <pool> --all --yes`, or prune deletion commands such as `treehouse prune --yes` and `treehouse prune --prune-orphans --yes`.

Commands in each list run sequentially in the worktree directory, via the OS shell (`/bin/sh -c` on Linux/macOS, `%COMSPEC% /c` on Windows).
If a command exits non-zero, treehouse logs the command, exit code, and stderr, then continues with the remaining commands.
A failing hook does not fail the overall `get`, `destroy`, or `prune` operation.

## Development

```sh
make build          # Build the binary
make test           # Run tests
make lint           # Run gofmt + go vet
make dist           # Cross-compile for all platforms
make install        # Install to $GOPATH/bin or /usr/local/bin
make clean          # Remove build artifacts
```
